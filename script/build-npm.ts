    /**
     * @20240830 HACK:
     * Currently, it seems that there's a bug as described below:
     * - `deno task launch`
     * - during the execution of `deno task build`, there's a node_modules will be created in the root folder
     * - that node_modules will finally cause the failed build
     * - but if you remove that node_modules and run  `deno task build` solely, it will be successful.
     *
     * It seems like the root cause is not really just the generated node_modules
     * (which shouldn't be generated), but the setting `test` in dnt configuration.
     *
     * Turn it off can make build successful.
     *
     * Note that, it seems like some npm packages can cause deno to generate node_modules,
     * and there's an option that can force that to be generated, which has been used in deno.json: `nodeModulesDir`
